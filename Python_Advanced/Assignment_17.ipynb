    "(1) Greeedy Technique -The usual rule for matching in REs is sometimes called “left-most longest“: when a pattern can be matched at more than one place within a string, the chosen match will be the one that starts at the earliest possible position within the string, and then extends as far as possible. Normally Perl pattern matching is greedy. By greedy, we mean that the parser tries to match as much as possible. (2) In greedy approach regex pattern tend to consume maximum characters in a source string\n",

    "Non-Greedy Technique -(1) A non-greedy match means that the regex engine matches as few characters as possible—so that it still can match the pattern in the given string. ... In other words, the non-greedy quantifiers give you the shortest possible match from a given position in the string. (2) In Non Greedy Technique regex pattern tend to consume minimum character in a source technique.\n",
